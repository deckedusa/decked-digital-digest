# NetSuite Scripts

A lot of changes happen in NetSuite that are not official releases. Here we will include changes that involve code releases to scripts.

## 25.05.27 - LTL item skid qty update

**CargoGlide LTL Items SKID QTY is 3**
    - CargoGlide 1000, 1500, and 2200 series items have been updated with Skid QTY of 3. If an order includes 3 or more of these specific CargoGlide units, the Ship Status will automatically be set to "OTHER FREIGHT TBD."

**Enhanced Logic to respect SKID QTY of LTL Items**
    - The system now checks the predefined SKID quantity of the LTL items. The default SKID QTY is 7; if the SKID QTY is not empty, the system assumes it is 7.
    - What this means: If LTL SKID RATIO is equal to or greater than 1, based on their individual Skid Quantities (e.g., standard LTL items have a Skid Qty of 7, while specific CargoGlide LTL items have a Skid Qty of 3), the order's Ship Status will be automatically set to "OTHER FREIGHT TBD."

> **Example of the new logic:**
> An order containing 3 Drawer Systems and 2 LTL CargoGlides will now have its Shipping Status set to "OTHER FREIGHT TBD", even though the number of items is less than 7. This is because the system is now using the specific Skid Quantities for each of these LTL item types to make this determination, rather than just looking at the total count (7) of LTL items.

**Specific Handling for "ACC SKID" LTL Items**
    - If an order includes the LTL item "ACC SKID" and its Ship Status is accidentally set to "PENDING," the system will now prevent an unnecessary order split. Instead, the Ship Status will be automatically corrected to "OTHER FREIGHT TBD."
    
**Protection for "Will Call" & "Other Freight" Ship Methods**
- If you manually set an order's Ship Method to "Will Call" or "Other Freight," the system will no longer override this selection with a FedEx (or other carrier) shipping method. Your chosen "Will Call" or "Other Freight" method will be preserved.
